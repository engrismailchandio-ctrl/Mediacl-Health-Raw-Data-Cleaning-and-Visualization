# Medical-Health-Raw-Data-Cleaning-and-Visualization
I took a raw data of medical/health care system from Kagal. The data has errors of data types, inconsistence, duplicate values and Nan Values. I clean data and finally visualize through chart to showcase insights of data.
Initially I downloaded a file of raw data of health from Kagal. The data has 10 columns and 1000 rows. The initial data has any many errors that visualization or insights were difficult to extract. Thus, I import the file in python notebook. Find out errors and inconsistencies using df.head(), df.info(), df.isnull().sum() and other commands. The duplicates were removed, The NaN values of integer/float data type columns were fill by mean and median where according to requirements. One of the columns name as 'Smoker'(Yes/No) has 20% missing values. That values were filled in proportion of given values of Yes/No in columns. The Time column's data type was changed to dateTime. According to given age, typically falling in 20 to 70 years, the new categorical columns was added named as age_group. The newly created column was given four categorical values as Child, Young, Adult and Old. Based on given age_group and gender columns, I tried to visualized that smokers of adult age affected with Diabetes and Heart Disease. The charts are showing insights clearly.
